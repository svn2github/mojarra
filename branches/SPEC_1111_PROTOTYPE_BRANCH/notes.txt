Notes on Frank meeting

Open issues:

- Our decision to standardize TagDecorator, but not provide default
  implementations for its helper classes has led to this feature being
  underutilized.

- It may be the case that we need to expose these helper classes as part
  of the work that is being done in 1111-passThroughElement.

- On line 127 of DefaultTagDecorator, we convert anything that we
  already don't understand to an h:panelGroup.  This assumption will not
  be valid in all cases, so we need a more flexible solution.  Perhaps
  we can fall back to the javax.faces.passthrough renderer solution.

- How do we deal with the case when people try to use the feature
  outside the box in which they are allowed to use it?  For example
  using <form method="GET">?

- Revisit the contract between DefaultTagDecorator and
  HtmlResponseWriter.
